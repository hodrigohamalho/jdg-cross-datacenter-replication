Downloading Binaries
--------------------

Ensure that the __four__ essential binaries exist in the __binaries__ folder of the demo project. The binaries folder structure should resemble the list below:

1. [jboss-datagrid-6.6.0-server.zip](http://www.jboss.org/download-manager/file/jboss-datagrid-6.6.0.GA.zip)
2. [jboss-eap-6.4.0.zip](https://www.jboss.org/download-manager/file/jboss-eap-6.4.0.GA.zip)
3. jdg-visualizer.war
4. hotrod-demo.jar

Every attempt has been made to automate the download of items #3 and #4. For #1 and #2, you need to have a [http://www.jboss.org](http://www.jboss.org) community login to be able to download the binaries. 

If you do not have a login, its about time you had one! [Click here](https://community.jboss.org/register.jspa) to register!
